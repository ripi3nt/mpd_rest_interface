# MPD Rest interface

This is a project I made since I had the need to remotely control my MPD(music player deamon). It exposes the MPD functionality through a REST API using the axum and mpd crates. It still does not have all the features 
implemented and I will most likely only implement the ones I need. However I wish to make this a proper server so implementing logging and having better error handling are things I wish to do beside implenting more 
features

## Todo:


- [ ] Logging — A logger that wont slow down the response time of the server
- [ ] Error Handling — A way to handle errors such that when one occurs the program doesn't panic
- [ ] More MPD functionality
- [ ] AI reccomendations - Make an AI agent that will be able to choose the music I want through a prompt

## Notes

Still very much a work in progress, so expect things to change.  
Open to ideas, suggestions, or just random feedback!
